# pathtrees_project
Path trees among pairs of trees

    usage: pathtrees.py [-h] [-o OUTPUTDIR] [-v] [-p PLOTFILE] [-n NUMPATHTREES]
                        [-b NUMBESTTREES] [-r NUM_RANDOM_TREES] [-g OUTGROUP]
                        [-i NUM_ITERATIONS] [-e] [-bound] [-f] [-allopt] [-opt]
                        [-optnr]
                        STARTTREES DATAFILE

Create a geodesic path in the Bilera-Holmes-Vogtman treespace between all trees in the treelist, a treefile and a
sequence data file are mandatory, if the the option -r N is used then the
treefile (which can be empty) will be augemented with N random trees and the
pathtree method is then run on those trees

    positional arguments:
    STARTTREES            mandatory input file that holds a set of trees in
                          Newick format
    DATAFILE              mandatory input file that holds a sequence data set in
                          PHYLIP format

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -o OUTPUTDIR, --output OUTPUTDIR
                        directory that holds the output files
    -v, --verbose         Do not remove the intermediate files generated by GPT
    -p PLOTFILE, --plot PLOTFILE
                        Create an MDS plot from the generated distances
    -n NUMPATHTREES, --np NUMPATHTREES, --numpathtrees NUMPATHTREES
                        Number of trees along the path between two initial
                        trees
    -b NUMBESTTREES, --best NUMBESTTREES, --numbesttrees NUMBESTTREES
                        Number of trees selected from the best likliehood
                        trees for the next round of refinement
    -r NUM_RANDOM_TREES, --randomtrees NUM_RANDOM_TREES
                        Generate num_random_trees rooted trees using the
                        sequence data individual names.
    -g OUTGROUP, --outgroup OUTGROUP
                        Forces an outgroup when generating random trees.
    -i NUM_ITERATIONS, --iterate NUM_ITERATIONS
                        Takes the trees, generates the pathtrees, then picks
                        the 10 best trees and reruns pathtrees, this will add
                        an iteration number to the outputdir, and also adds
                        iteration to the plotting.
    -e, --extended        If the phylip dataset is in the extended format, use
                        this.
    -bound, --hull, --boundary
                        Start the iteration using a convex hull instead of n
                        best likelihood trees.
    -f, --fast, --wrf     use weighted Robinson-Foulds distance for MDS plotting
                        [fast], if false use GTP derived geodesic distance
                        [slow]
    -allopt, --alloptimize, --allopt
                        calculates the pathtrees and then finds all optimal
                        branchlengths for each of them
    -opt, --optimize, --opt
                        finds optimal branchlengths for the best trees
